<h1 id="translating-learning-bitcoin-from-the-command-line">Translating
Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in translating Learning Bitcoin from the
Command Line! What follows is our standard procedure for doing so. If
you have any questions, please file an Issue.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Please Follow Our Normal Contributor Procedure.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Read over <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</li>
<li>Fill out a <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/CLA.md">Contributor
License Agreement</a>, sign it with GPG, and submit it as a PR. Be sure
this is done for everyone who contributes to the translation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Choose a Release.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Choose a <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases">Release</a>
as the basis of your translation. We generally suggest the latest
release. This will ensure the consistency of all the files in your
translation, will insulate you from any changes we make, and will make
it easy to see what has changed when we create a new release.</li>
<li>If it looks like there hasn’t been a new Release in a while, file an
Issue saying you’re interested in starting a new translation, and asking
if it would make sense for there to be a new Release milestone before
you do so. If there’s been anything notable, and we’re not in the middle
of things, we’ll likely create a new patch or minor version. If we’re in
the middle of things, we’ll just suggest you use the previous
Release.</li>
<li>Label your table of contents and each chapter or section with the
release used.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Request a Branch.</strong>
<ul>
<li>File an <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/issues">Issue</a>
requesting a new branch for your translation.</li>
<li>This will be the master place for us to collect work on the
translation over time.</li>
<li>We will create a top-level directory for your complete translation
using the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1
language code</a>, for example <code>es</code> (Spanish),
<code>fr</code> (French), or <code>pt</code> (Portuguese). Work should
be done in that directory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fork the Branch.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once we’ve created a translation branch, you’ll then want to fork
that into your own GitHub account.</li>
<li>Generally, we suggest that you create one working branch off that
translation branch for each separate chapter. This will allow you to
work through the process of write/review/revise for each individual
chapter without it getting tangled up with your new content for future
chapters, and will allow us to merge the chapters as they’re completed,
which is our preference, and will help everyone to keep track of where
things our.</li>
<li>Make sure you <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits">sign
your commits</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Submit PRs a Chapter at a Time.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Submit your PRs for the translation from your working fork to our
translation branch in batches of no more than a single chapter at a
time.</li>
<li>Submit in smaller batches if it makes sense, for example because
different people are writing different sections.</li>
<li>Again, we suggest that there be a branch for each chapter, so when
you submit your PR for one chapter, you’ll usually then create a branch
for the next chapter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Request Approval from a Native Speaker.</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>No one can ever do a great edit of their own work, so we require
each section to be approved by someone other than the original
translator.</p></li>
<li><p>This fundamentally means that any translation team
<em>should</em> contain at least two members, either one translator and
one editor or else two people who trade off roles of translator and
editor. If your team doesn’t have a second member, we can put out a call
for an editor/approver when you submit a PR, but it’s possible that we
won’t be able to find one, and your hard work will languish, so it’s s
better to have one up front.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the editing and reviewing process easier, independent,
and streamlined, we suggest that you and the reviewer <a
href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository">request
access to each other’s forks</a>. Once invited, the <em>reviewer</em>
can then:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Easily checkout the PR into their local machine with <a
href="https://cli.github.com/">GitHub CLI</a> by doing
<code>gh pr checkout &lt;pr-number&gt;</code>. This will automatically
create a branch with the PR code for the reviewer to work on.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, perform their changes with signed commits.</p></li>
<li><p>And do <code>git push</code> after finishing the review to have
the changes reflected in the PR.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Request Approval from the Blockchain Commons Team.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once a chapter or section has been approved by a native speaker,
request approval from someone on the Blockchain Commons team: currently
<a href="https://github.com/shannona"><span class="citation"
data-cites="shannona">@shannona</span></a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Continue!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Continue through the process, no more than one chapter at a time,
until you have a full book.</li>
<li>Be aware of the scope of the overall project. As of v2.01, Learning
Bitcoin from the Command Line is 120,000 words in length. As a book,
that’d be 250-400 pages, depending on the format and layout. (About
90,000 words of that is text to translate, with the remainder being
code.) You want to make sure you have the time for that level of
commitment before getting started.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Let Us Know When You’re Done.</strong>
<ul>
<li>When you’ve completed your translation, file an issue to let us know
that the translation branch is ready to be merged into the master.</li>
<li>This will also let us know to announce the completed translation and
link it into the master README</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Update Your Translation with New Releases</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is our hope that translations will stay up to day with new
releases, particularly major and minor releases, which are likely to
include new content and updates. Currently, these only occur ever few
years</li>
<li>If you have decided to stop updating a translation, please let us
know in an Issue, so that we can let the community know that we are
looking for a new translator to continue updating a translation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="workflow-example">WORKFLOW EXAMPLE</h3>
<p>Chapter 3 has 7 subsections: 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, Interlude 3.3, 3.4
and 3.5. Suppose you want to translate it to french.</p>
<p>One approach to its translation would be to create a branch
<code>french-3</code> from <code>french-translation</code> branch
(created in the previous step). Then create a translation file for the
3.0 subsection. When you think that chapter 3.0 is ready for review you
commit your changes and continue with the next file, subsection 3.1.
Repeat the same process for this file and all the following. After this,
your branch <code>french-3</code> will diverge from the base branch
(<code>french-translation</code> in this case) by 7 different commits,
one for each subsection, plus some more commits if you forgot to make
some changes or need to correct others. At this point you are ready to
push your changes to your fork and open a pull request to the original
repository.</p>
<p>In the review process you will discuss some decisions with your
reviewer and introduce new changes in the form of commits if you have to
change some parts of your modifications. Don’t forget to commit those
changes in meaningful chunks and push them to your fork. After polishing
your changes, your reviewer will accept your changes and it will request
the merge of those changes on the <code>french-translation</code>
branch. Note that you can also push your changes and create your pull
request after your first commit. This will allow the reviewer to start
reviewing before you finish all chapter translation.</p>
<p>You can track the state of the translation of that particular chapter
in the body of the pull request, with the following template:</p>
<pre><code>This pull request creates the &lt;translated_language&gt; version of the chapter
&lt;chapter_number&gt; of Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line.

Things to check:
- Respect filenames and chapter names from translated [README](local/path/to/README).
- Correct translation.
- Term consistency: review [&quot;translation memory&quot;](local/path/to/file) file.
- Good punctuation.
- Correct linking.
- Nice formatting.

| Sub chapter   |       Translated        |         Reviewed        |          Done           |
| ------------- |   :--------------:      |    :--------------:     |    :--------------:     |
| _0_           | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| _1_           | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| _2_           | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| _3_           | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |
| _etc_         | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; | &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; [ ] &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; |</code></pre>
<h3 id="final-suggestions">FINAL SUGGESTIONS:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Keep lines under 80 characters</em>. Markdown parser will format
them right (double check that) and the review process will be
easier.</li>
<li><em>Translate <code>README.md</code> file first</em> and use it as
reference for the translation of all the following chapter names,
filenames and link names. The README represents the state of the master
branch at the moment of begin the translation process. It will be
consulted by all translators to know how to translate file and chapter
names. Try to reach an agreement with the other translators about those
names before writing any chapter and keep further changes of this file
to minimum.</li>
<li><em>Create a “translation memory” file</em> with special words that
could have multiple translations under the same contexts and the
translation chosen for them. Good candidates to be in this list would be
domain specific words, like: multisig, input, output, script, timelock,
locktime, hash, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, thank you!</p>
