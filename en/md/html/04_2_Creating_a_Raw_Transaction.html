<h1 id="creating-a-raw-transaction">4.2 Creating a Raw Transaction</h1>
<p>You’re now ready to create Bitcoin raw transactions. This allows you
to send money but to craft the transactions as precisely as you want.
This first section focuses on a simple one-input, one-output
transaction. This sort of transaction <em>isn’t</em> actually that
useful, because you’re rarely going to want to send all of your money to
one person (unless you’re actually just forwarding it on, such as if
you’re moving things from one wallet to another). Thus, we don’t label
this section as a way to send money. It’s just a foundational stepping
stone to <em>actually</em> sending money with a raw transaction.</p>
<h2 id="understand-the-bitcoin-transaction">Understand the Bitcoin
Transaction</h2>
<p>Before you dive into actually creating raw transactions, you should
make sure you understand how a Bitcoin transaction works. It’s all about
the UTXOs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a UTXO?</em></strong> When you receive
cash in your Bitcoin wallet, it appears as an individual transaction.
Each of these transactions is called a Unspent Transaction Output
(UTXO). It doesn’t matter if various payments were made to the same
address or to multiple addresses: each incoming transaction remains
distinct in your wallet as a UTXO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you create a new outgoing transaction, you gather together one
or more UTXOs, each of which represents a blob of money that you
received. You use these as inputs for a new transaction. Together their
amount must equal what you want to spend <em>or more</em>. Then, you
generate one or more outputs, which give the money represented by the
inputs to one or more people. This creates new UTXOs for the recipients,
which may then use <em>those</em> to fund future transactions.</p>
<p>Here’s the trick: <em>all of the UTXOs that you gather are spent in
full!</em> That means that if you want to send just part of the money in
a UTXO to someone else, then you also have to generate an additional
output that sends the rest back to you! For now, we won’t worry about
that, but the use of a change address will be vital when moving on from
the theory of this chapter to more practical transactions.</p>
<h2 id="list-your-unspent-transactions">List Your Unspent
Transactions</h2>
<p>In order to create a new raw transaction, you must know what UTXOs
you have on-hand to spend. You can determine this information with the
<code>bitcoin-cli listunspent</code> command:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This listing shows three different UTXOs, worth .0001, .0005 and
.00022 BTC. Note that each has its own distinct txid and remains
distinct in the wallet, even the last two, which were sent to the same
address.</p>
<p>When you want to spend a UTXO, it’s not sufficient to just know the
transaction id. That’s because each transaction can have multiple
outputs! Remember that first chunk of money that the faucet sent us? In
the transaction, some money went to us and some went to someone else.
The <code>txid</code> refers to the overall transaction, while a
<code>vout</code> says which of multiple outputs you’ve received. In
this list, each of these transactions is the 0th <code>vout</code> of a
previous transaction, but <em>that doesn’t have to be the case</em>.</p>
<p>So, txid+vout=UTXO. This will be the foundation of any raw
transaction.</p>
<h2 id="write-a-raw-transaction-with-one-output">Write a Raw Transaction
with One Output</h2>
<p>You’re now ready to write a simple, example raw transaction that
shows how to send the entirety of a UTXO to another party. As noted,
this is not necessarily a very realistic real-world case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> It is very easy to lose money
with a raw transaction. Consider all instructions on sending bitcoins
via raw transactions to be <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> dangerous.
Whenever you’re actually sending real money to other people, you should
instead use one of the other methods explained in this chapter. Creating
raw transactions is extremely useful if you’re writing bitcoin programs,
but <em>only</em> when you’re writing bitcoin programs. (For example: in
writing this example for one version of this tutorial, we accidentally
spent the wrong transaction, even though it had about 10x as much value.
Almost all of that was lost to the miners.)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="prepare-the-raw-transaction">Prepare the Raw Transaction</h3>
<p>For best practices, we’ll start out each transaction by carefully
recording the txids and vouts that we’ll be spending.</p>
<p>In this case, we’re going to spend the one worth .00050000 BTC
because it’s the only one with a decent value.</p>
<pre><code>$ utxo_txid=&quot;61f3b7016bf1ecc3987b8805207e79362e4de8026682e149107999b779426e3a&quot;
$ utxo_vout=&quot;1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You should similarly record your recipient address, to make sure you
have it right. We’re again sending some money back to the TP faucet:</p>
<pre><code>$ recipient=&quot;n2eMqTT929pb1RDNuqEnxdaLau1rxy3efi&quot;</code></pre>
<p>As always, check your variables carefully, to make sure they’re what
you expect!</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $utxo_txid
61f3b7016bf1ecc3987b8805207e79362e4de8026682e149107999b779426e3a
$ echo $utxo_vout
1
$ echo $recipient
n2eMqTT929pb1RDNuqEnxdaLau1rxy3efi</code></pre>
<p>That recipient is particularly important, because if you mess it up,
your money is <em>gone</em>! (And as we already saw, choosing the wrong
transaction can result in lost money!) So triple check it all.</p>
<h3 id="understand-the-transaction-fee">Understand the Transaction
Fee</h3>
<p>Each transaction has a fee associated with. It’s <em>implicit</em>
when you send a raw transaction: the amount that you will pay as a fee
is always equal to the amount of your input minus the amount of your
output. So, you have to decrease your output a little bit from your
input to make sure that your transaction goes out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> This is the very dangerous part
of raw transactions!! Because you automatically expend all of the amount
in the UTXOs that you use, it’s critically important to make sure that
you know: (1) precisely what UTXOs you’re using; (2) exactly how much
money they contain; (3) exactly how much money you’re sending out; and
(4) what the difference is. If you mess up and you use the wrong UTXO
(with more money than you thought) or if you send out too little money,
the excess is lost. Forever. Don’t make that mistake! Know your inputs
and outputs <em>precisely</em>. Or better, don’t use raw transactions
except as part of a carefully considered and triple-checked program.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>How much should you spend on transaction
fees?</em></strong> <a href="https://bitcoinfees.21.co/">Bitcoin
Fees</a> has a nice live assessment. It says that the “fastest and
cheapest transaction fee is currently 42 satoshis/byte” and that “For
the median transaction size of 224 bytes, this results in a fee of 9,408
satoshis”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently Bitcoin Fees suggests a transaction fee of about 10,000
satoshis, which is the same as .0001 BTC. Yes, that’s for the mainnet,
not the testnet, but we want to test out things realistically, so that’s
what we’re going to use.</p>
<p>In this case, that means taking the .0005 BTC in the UTXO we’re
selected, reducing it by .0001 BTC for the transaction fee, and sending
the remaining .0004 BTC. (And this is an example of why micropayments
don’t work on the Bitcoin network, because a $1 or so transaction fee is
pretty expensive when you’re sending $4, let alone if you were trying to
make a micropayment of $0.50. But that’s always why we have
Lightning.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> The lower that you set your
transaction fee, the longer before your transaction is built into a
block. The Bitcoin Fees site lists expected times, from an expected 0
blocks, to 22. Since blocks are built on average every 10 minutes,
that’s the difference between a few minutes and a few hours! So, choose
a transaction fee that’s appropriate for what you’re sending. Note that
you should never drop below the minimum relay fee, which is .0001
BTC.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="write-the-raw-transaction">Write the Raw Transaction</h3>
<p>You’re now ready to create the raw transaction. This uses the
<code>createrawtransaction</code> command, which might look a little
intimidating. That’s because the <code>createrawtransaction</code>
command doesn’t entirely shield you from the JSON RPC that the
bitcoin-cli uses. Instead, you are going to input a JSON array to list
the UTXOs that you’re spending and a JSON object to list the
outputs.</p>
<p>Here’s the standard format:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction
&#39;&#39;&#39;[
     {
       &quot;txid&quot;: &quot;&#39;$your_txid&#39;&quot;,
       &quot;vout&quot;: &#39;$your_vout&#39;
      }
]&#39;&#39;&#39;
&#39;&#39;&#39;{
   &quot;&#39;$your_recipient&#39;&quot;: bitcoin_amount
 }&#39;&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, there are all kinds of crazy quotes there, but trust that
they’ll do the right thing. Use <code>'''</code> to mark the start and
end of the JSON array and the JSON object. Protect normal words like
<code>"this"</code>, but you don’t need to protect normal numbers:
<code>0</code>. If they’re variables, insert single quotes, like
<code>"'$this_word'"</code> and <code>'$this_num'</code>. (Whew. You’ll
get used to it.)</p>
<p>Here’s a command that creates a raw transaction to send your $utxo to
your $recipient
<code>$ rawtxhex=$(bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction '''[ { "txid": "'$utxo_txid'", "vout": '$utxo_vout' } ]''' '''{ "'$recipient'": 0.0004 }''') $ echo $rawtxhex 02000000013a6e4279b799791049e1826602e84d2e36797e2005887b98c3ecf16b01b7f3610100000000ffffffff01409c0000000000001976a914e7c1345fc8f87c68170b3aa798a956c2fe6a9eff88ac00000000</code></p>

<p>Check the <code>vin</code>. Are you spending the right transaction?
Does it contain the expected amount of money? (Check with
<code>bitcoin-cli gettransaction</code> and be sure to look at the right
<code>vout</code>.) Check your <code>vout</code>. Are you sending the
right amount? Is it going to the right address? Finally, do the math to
make sure the money balances. Does the value of the UTXO minus the
amount being spent equal the expected transaction fee?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:information_source: <strong>NOTE - SEQUENCE:</strong> You may note
that each input has a sequence number, set here to 4294967295, which is
0xFFFFFFFF. This is the last frontier of Bitcoin transactions, because
it’s a standard field in transactions that was originally intended for a
specific purpose, but was never fully implemented. So now there’s this
integer sitting around in transactions that could be repurposed for
other uses. And, in fact, it has been. As of this writing there are
three different uses for the variable that’s called
<code>nSequence</code> in the Bitcoin Core code: it enables RBF,
<code>nLockTime</code>, and relative timelocks. If there’s nothing weird
going on, <code>nSequence</code> will be set to 4294967295. Setting it
to a lower value signals that special stuff is going on.</p>

parse it out of the JSON object. A software package called “JQ” could do
better, as we’ll explain in an upcoming interlude.</p>

<p>You’ve now got a ready-to-go raw transaction, but it doesn’t count
until you actually put it on the network, which you do with the
<code>sendrawtransaction</code> command. You’ll get back a txid:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction $signedtx

from your wallet:</p>

<p>You can see that it matches the <code>txid</code> and the
<code>recipient</code> address. Not only does it show the
<code>amount</code> sent, but it also shows the transaction
<code>fee</code>. And, it’s already received a confirmation, because we
offered a fee that would get it swept up into a block quickly.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You’re now a few satoshis poorer!</p>
<h2 id="summary-creating-a-raw-transaction">Summary: Creating a Raw
Transaction</h2>
<p>When money comes into your Bitcoin wallet, it remains as distinct
amounts, called UTXOs. When you create a raw transaction to send that
money back out, you use one or more UTXOs to fund it. You then can
create a raw transaction, sign it, and send it on the Bitcoin network.
However, this is just a foundation: you’ll usually need to create a raw
transaction with multiple outputs to actually send something on the
bitcoin network!</p>
