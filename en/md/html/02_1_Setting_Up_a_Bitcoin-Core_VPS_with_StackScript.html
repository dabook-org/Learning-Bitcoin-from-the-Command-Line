<h1 id="setting-up-a-bitcoin-core-vps-with-bitcoin-standup">2.1: Setting
Up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with Bitcoin Standup</h1>
<p>This document explains how to set up a VPS (Virtual Private Sever) to
run a Bitcoin node on Linode.com, installed using an automated
StackScript from the <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin
Standup project</a>. You just need to enter a few commands and boot your
VPS. Almost immediately after you boot, you’ll find your new Bitcoin
node happily downloading blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> Don’t use a VPS for a bitcoin
wallet with significant real funds; see
http://blog.thestateofme.com/2012/03/03/lessons-to-be-learned-from-the-linode-bitcoin-incident/
. It is very nice to be able experiment with real bitcoin transactions
on a live node without tying up a self-hosted server on a local network.
It’s also useful to be able to use an iPhone or iPad to communicate via
SSH to your VPS to do some simple bitcoin tasks. But a higher level of
safety is required for significant funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you want to understand what this setup does, read <a
href="A1_0_Understanding_Bitcoin_Standup.md">Appendix I: Understanding
Bitcoin Standup</a> as you install.</li>
<li>If you want to instead setup on a machine other than a Linode VPS,
such as an AWS machine or a Mac, goto <a
href="02_2_Setting_Up_Bitcoin_Core_Other.md">§2.2: Setting Up a
Bitcoin-Core via Other Means</a></li>
<li>If you already have a Bitcoin node running, goto <a

Understanding Your Bitcoin Setup</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-linode">Getting Started with Linode</h2>
<p>Linode is a Cloud Hosting service that offers quick, cheap Linux
servers with SSD storage. We use them for this tutorial primarily
because their BASH-driven StackScripts offer an easy way to
automatically set up a Bitcoin node with no fuss and no muss.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-a-linode-account">Set Up a Linode Account</h3>
<p>You can create a Linode account by going here:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.linode.com</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer, the following referral code will give you two months
worth of free usage (up to $100), great for learning Bitcoin:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.linode.com/?r=3c7fa15a78407c9a3d4aefb027539db2557b3765">https://www.linode.com/?r=3c7fa15a78407c9a3d4aefb027539db2557b3765</a></p>
<p>You’ll need to provide an email address and later preload money from
a credit card or PayPal for future costs.</p>
<p>When you’re done, you should land on <a
href="https://cloud.linode.com/dashboard">https://cloud.linode.com/dashboard</a>.</p>
<h3 id="consider-two-factor-authentication">Consider Two-Factor
Authentication</h3>
<p>Your server security won’t be complete if people can break into your
Linode account, so consider setting up Two-Factor Authentication for it.
You can find this setting on your <a
href="https://manager.linode.com/profile/auth">My Profile: Password
&amp; Authentication page</a>. If you don’t do this now, make a TODO
item to come back and do it later.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-linode-image-using-a-stackscript">Creating the
Linode Image using a StackScript</h2>
<h3 id="load-the-stackscript">Load the StackScript</h3>
<p>Download the <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts/blob/master/Scripts/LinodeStandUp.sh">Linode
Standup Script</a> from the <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin
Standup Scripts repo</a>. This script basically automates all Bitcoin
VPS setup instructions. If you want to be particulary prudent, read it
over carefully. If you are satisfied, you can copy that StackScript into
your own account by going to the <a
href="https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts?type=account">Stackscripts
page</a> on your Linode account and selecting to <a
href="https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts/create">Create New
Stackscript</a>. Give it a good name (we use
<code>Bitcoin Standup</code>), then copy and paste the script. Choose
Debian 11 for your target image and “Save” it.</p>
<h3 id="do-the-initial-setup">Do the Initial Setup</h3>
<p>You’re now ready to create a node based on the Stackscript.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the <a
href="https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts?type=account">Stackscripts
page</a>, click on the “…” to the right of your new script and choose
“Deploy New Linode”.</li>
<li>Fill in a short and a fully qualified hostname
<ul>
<li><strong>Short Hostname.</strong> Pick a name for your VPS. For
example, “mybtctest”.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Qualified Hostname.</strong> If you’re going to
include this VPS as part of a network with full DNS records, type in the
hostname with its domain. For example, “mybtctest.mydomain.com”.
Otherwise, just repeat the short hostname and add “.local”, for example
“mybtctest.local”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enter the password for the “standup” user.</li>
<li>Fill in the appropriate advanced options.
<ul>
<li><strong>X25519 Public Key.</strong> This is a public key to add to
Tor’s list of authorized clients. If you don’t use it, anyone who gets
the QR code for your node can access it. You’ll get this public key from
whichever client you’re using to connect to your node. For example, if
you use <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2">FullyNoded
2</a>, you can go to its settings and “Export Tor V3 Authentication
Public Key” for use here.</li>
<li><strong>Installation Type.</strong> This is likely “Mainnet” or
“Pruned Mainnet” if you are setting up a node for usage and “Testnet” or
“Pruned Testnet” if you’re just playing around. The bulk of this
tutorial will assume you chose “Pruned Testnet”, but you should still be
able to follow along with other types. See the <a
href="#synopsis-bitcoin-installation-types">Synopsis</a> for more
information on these options. (Note that if you plan to try out the
Lightning chapters, you’ll probably want to use an Unpruned node, as
working with Pruned nodes on Lightning is iffy. See <a
href="18_1_Verifying_Your_Lightning_Setup.md#compiling-the-source-code">§18.1</a>
for the specifics.)</li>
<li><strong>SSH Key.</strong> Copy your local computer’s SSH key
here; this allows you be able to automatically login in via SSH to the
standup account. If you haven’t setup an SSH key on your local computer
yet, there are good instructions for it on <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">Github</a>.
You may also want to add your SSH key into your Linode LISH (Linode
Interactive Shell) by going to your “Linode Home Page / My Preferences /
LISH Settings / LISH Keys”. Using an SSH key will give you a simpler and
safer way to log in to your server.</li>
<li><strong>SSH-Allowed IPs.</strong> This is a comma-separated list of
IPs that will be allowed to SSH into the VPS. For example
“192.168.1.15,192.168.1.16”. If you do not enter any IPs, <em>your VPS
will not be very secure</em>. It will constantly be bombarded by
attackers trying to find their way in, and they may very well
succeed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select an Image
<ul>
<li><strong>Target Image.</strong> If you followed the instructions,
this will only allow you to select “Debian 11” (though previous versions
of this Stackscript worked with Debian 9 or 10and might still).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose a region for where the Linode will be located.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The remaining questions all have to do with the mechanics of the
VPS deployment and should be left as they are with one exception: bump
the Swap Disk from 256MB to 512MB, to ensure that you have enough memory
to download the blockchain.</em></p>
<h3 id="choose-other-standup-options">Choose Other Standup Options</h3>
<p>Blockchain Commons is currently in the process of expanding its
Bitcoin Standup Scripts with options to install Lightning and other
Bitcoin apps of note. Take a look at any extra options, and see if
they’re things that you’d like to play with. In particular, if Lightning
is an option, we suggest installing it, because it will make <a
href="18_0_Understanding_Your_Lightning_Setup.md">Chapter 18</a> and <a
href="19_0_Using_Lightning.md">Chapter 19</a> much easier.</p>
<h3 id="choose-a-linode-plan">Choose a Linode Plan</h3>
<p>You’ll next to choose a Linode plan.</p>
<p>Linode will default to Dedicated-CPU plans, but you can select the
more cost-efficient Shared-CPU instead. A Shared-CPU Linode 4GB will
suffice for most setups, including: Pruned Mainnet, Pruned Testnet, and
even non-Pruned Testnet. They all use less than 50G of storage and 4GB
is a comfortable amount of memory. This is the setup we suggest. It runs
$20 per month.</p>
<p>If you want to instead have a non-Pruned Mainnet in a VPS, you’ll
need to install a Linode with a disk in excess of 280G(!), which is
currently the Linode 16GB, which has 320G of storage and 16G of memory
and costs approximately $80 per month. We do <em>not</em> suggest
this.</p>
<p>The following chart shows minimum requirements</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Setup</th>
<th>Memory</th>
<th>Storage</th>
<th>Linnode</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Mainnet</td>
<td>2G</td>
<td>280G</td>
<td>Linode 16GB</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pruned Mainnet</td>
<td>2G</td>
<td>~5G</td>
<td>Linode 4GB</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Testnet</td>
<td>2G</td>
<td>~15G</td>
<td>Linode 4GB</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pruned Testnet</td>
<td>2G</td>
<td>~5G</td>
<td>Linode 4GB</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Regtest</td>
<td>2G</td>
<td>~</td>
<td>Linode 4GB</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note, there may be ways to reduce both costs.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the machines we suggest as <strong>Linode 4GB</strong>, you may
be able to reduce that to a Linode 2GB. Some versions of Bitcoin Core
have worked well at that size, some have occasionally run out of memory
and then recovered, and some have continuously run out of memory.
Remember to up that swap space to maximize the odds of this working. Use
at your own risk.</li>
<li>For the Unpruned Mainnet, which we suggest as a <strong>Linode
16GB</strong>, you can probably get by with a Linode 4GB, but add <a
href="https://cloud.linode.com/volumes">Block Storage</a> sufficient to
store the blockchain. This is certainly a better long-term solution
since the Bitcoin blockchain’s storage requirements continuously
increase if you don’t prune, while the CPU requirements don’t (or don’t
to the same degree). A 320 GibiByte storage would be $32 a month, which
combined with a Linode 4GB is $52 a month, instead of $80, and more
importantly you can keep growing it. We don’t fully document this setup
for two reasons (1) we don’t suggest the unpruned mainnet setup, and so
we suspect it’s a much less common setup; and (2) we haven’t tested how
Linodes volumes compare to their intrinic SSDs for performance and
usage. But there’s full documentation on the Block Storage page. You’d
need to set up the Linode, run its stackscript, but then interrupt it to
move the blockchain storage overly to a newly commissioned volume before
continuing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are running a deployment that will be transacting real
Bitcoins, you may want to alternatively consider a Dedicated-CPU Linode,
which tends to run 50% more expensive than the Shared-CPU Linode. We’ve
generally found the Shared CPUs to be entirely sufficient, but for a
wide deployment, you may wish to consider higher levels of
reliability.</p>
<h3 id="do-the-final-setup">Do the Final Setup</h3>
<p>The last thing you need to do is enter a root password. (If you
missed anything, you’ll be told so now!)</p>
<p>Click “Deploy” to initialize your disks and to prepare your VPS. The
whole queue should run in less than a minute. When it’s done you should
see in the “Host Job Queue”, green “Success” buttons stating “Disk
Create from StackScript - Setting password for root… done.” and “Create
Filesystem - 256MB Swap Image”.</p>
<p>You may now want to change your Linode VPS’s name from the default
<code>linodexxxxxxxx</code>. Go to the Settings tab, and change the
label to be more useful, such as your VPS’s short hostname. For instance
you might name it <code>bitcoin-testnet-pruned</code> to differentiate
it from other VPSs in your account.</p>
<h2 id="login-to-your-vps">Login to Your VPS</h2>
<p>If you watch your Linode control panel, you should see the new
computer spin up. When the job has reached 100%, you’ll be able to
login.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need the IP address. Click on the “Linodes” tab and you
should see a listing of your VPS, the fact that it’s running, its
“plan”, its IP address, and some other information.</p>
<p>Go to your local console and login to the <code>standup</code>
account using that address:</p>
<pre><code>ssh standup@[IP-ADDRESS]</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>ssh standup@192.168.33.11</code></pre>
<p>If you configured your VPS to use an SSH key, the login should be
automatic (possibly requiring your SSH password to unlock your key). If
you didn’t configure a SSH key, then you’ll need to type in the user1
password.</p>
<h3 id="wait-a-few-minutes">Wait a Few Minutes</h3>
<p>Here’s a little catch: <em>your StackScript is running right
now</em>. The BASH script gets executed the first time the VPS is
booted. That means your VPS isn’t ready yet.</p>
<p>The total run time is about 10 minutes. So, go take a break, get an
espresso, or otherwise relax for a few minutes. There are two parts of
the script that take a while: the updating of all the Debian packages;
and the downloading of the Bitcoin code. They shouldn’t take more than 5
minutes each, which means if you come back in 10 minutes, you’ll
probably be ready to go.</p>
<p>If you’re impatient you can jump ahead and
<code>sudo tail -f /standup.log</code> which will display the current
progress of installation, as described in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="verify-your-installation">Verify Your Installation</h2>
<p>You’ll know that stackscrpit is done when the <code>tail</code> of
the <code>standup.log</code> says something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>/root/StackScript - Bitcoin is setup as a service and will automatically start if your VPS reboots and so is Tor
/root/StackScript - You can manually stop Bitcoin with: sudo systemctl stop bitcoind.service
/root/StackScript - You can manually start Bitcoin with: sudo systemctl start bitcoind.service</code></pre>
<p>At that point, your home directory should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls
bitcoin-22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz  keys.txt  SHA256SUMS  SHA256SUMS.asc</code></pre>
<p>These are the various files that were used to install Bitcoin on your
VPS. <em>None</em> of them are necessary. We’ve just left them in case
you want to do any additional verification. Otherwise, you can delete
them:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm *</code></pre>
<h3 id="verify-the-bitcoin-setup">Verify the Bitcoin Setup</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that the downloaded Bitcoin release is valid, the
StackScript checks both the signature and the SHA checksum. You should
verify that both of those tests came back right:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo grep VERIFICATION /standup.log</code></pre>
<p>If you see something like the following, all should be well:</p>
<pre><code>./standup.sh - SIG VERIFICATION SUCCESS: 9 GOOD SIGNATURES FOUND.
./standup.sh - SHA VERIFICATION SUCCESS / SHA: bitcoin-22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK</code></pre>
<p>If either of those two checks instead reads “VERIFICATION ERROR”,
then there’s a problem.</p>
<p>The log also contains more information on the Signatures, if you want
to make sure you know <em>who</em> signed the Bitcoin release:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo grep -i good /standup.log
./standup.sh - SIG VERIFICATION SUCCESS: 9 GOOD SIGNATURES FOUND.
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Andrew Chow (Official New Key) &lt;achow101@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Ben Carman &lt;benthecarman@live.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Antoine Poinsot &lt;darosior@protonmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Stephan Oeste (it) &lt;it@oeste.de&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Michael Ford (bitcoin-otc) &lt;fanquake@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Oliver Gugger &lt;gugger@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Hennadii Stepanov (hebasto) &lt;hebasto@gmail.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Jon Atack &lt;jon@atack.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]
gpg: Good signature from &quot;Wladimir J. van der Laan &lt;laanwj@visucore.com&gt;&quot; [unknown]</code></pre>
<p>Since this is all scripted, it’s possible that there’s just been a
minor change that has caused the script’s checks not to work right.
(This has happened a few times over the existence of the script that
became Standup.) But, it’s also possible that someone is trying to
encourage you to run a fake copy of the Bitcoin daemon. So, <em>be very
sure you know what happened before you make use of Bitcoin!</em></p>
<h3 id="read-the-logs">Read the Logs</h3>
<p>You may also want to read through all of the setup log files, to make
sure that nothing unexpected happened during the installation.</p>
<p>It’s best to look through the standard StackScript log file, which
has all of the output, including errors:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo more /standup.log</code></p>
<p>Note that it is totally normal to see <em>some</em> errors,
particularly when running the very noisy gpg software and when various
things try to access the non-existant <code>/dev/tty</code> device.</p>
<p>If you want instead to look at a smaller set of info, all of the
errors should be in:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo more /standup.err</code></p>
<p>It still has a fair amount of information that isn’t errors, but it’s
a quicker read.</p>
<p>If all look good, congratulations, you have a functioning Bitcoin
node using Linode!</p>
<h2 id="what-we-have-wrought">What We Have Wrought</h2>
<p>Although the default Debian 11 image that we are using for your VPS
has been modified by Linode to be relatively secure, your Bitcoin node
as installed through the Linode StackScript is set up with an even
higher level of security. You may find this limiting, or be unable to do
things that you expect. Here are a few notes on that:</p>
<h3 id="protected-services">Protected Services</h3>
<p>Your Bitcoin VPS installation is minimal and allows almost no
communication. This is done through the uncomplicated firewall
(<code>ufw</code>), which blocks everything except SSH connections.
There’s also some additional security possible for your RFC ports,
thanks to the hidden services installed by Tor.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting UFW.</strong> You should probably leave UFW in its
super-protected stage! You don’t want to use a Bitcoin machine for other
services, because everyone increases your vulnerability! If you decide
otherwise, there are several <a
href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands">guides
to UFW</a> that will allow you to add services. As advertised, it’s
uncomplicated. For example adding mail services would just require
opening the mail port: <code>sudo ufw allow 25</code>. But don’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>Adjusting Tor.</strong> You might want to better protect
services like SSH. See <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/14_0_Using_Tor.md">Chapter
14: Using Tor</a> for more on Tor.</p>
<h3 id="protected-shells">Protected Shells</h3>
<p>If you defined “SSH-allowed IPs”, SSH (and SCP) access to the server
is severely restricted. <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> disallows anyone
from logging in. <em>We do not suggest changing this</em>.
<code>/etc/hosts.allow</code> then allows specific IP addresses. Just
add more IP addresses in a comma-separated list if you need to offer
more access.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>sshd: 127.0.0.1, 192.128.23.1</code></pre>
<h3 id="automated-upgrades">Automated Upgrades</h3>
<p>Debian is also set up to automatically upgrade itself, to ensure that
it remains abreast of the newest security patches.</p>
<p>If for some reason you wanted to change this (<em>we don’t suggest
it</em>), you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;unattended-upgrades unattended-upgrades/enable_auto_updates boolean false&quot; | debconf-set-selections</code></pre>

<h2 id="playing-with-bitcoin">Playing with Bitcoin</h2>
<p>So now you probably want to play with Bitcoin!</p>
<p>But wait, your Bitcoin daemon is probably still downloading blocks.
The <code>bitcoin-cli getblockcount</code> will tell you how you’re
currently doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli getblockcount
1771352</code></pre>
<p>If it’s different every time you type the command, you need to wait
before working with Bitcoin. This takes 1-6 hours currently for a pruned
setup, depending on your precise machine.</p>
<p>But, once it settles at a number, you’re ready to continue!</p>
<p>Still, it might be time for a few more espressos. But soon enough,
your system will be ready to go, and you’ll be read to start
experimenting.</p>

Installation Types</h2>
<p><strong>Mainnet.</strong> This will download the entirety of the
Bitnet blockchain. That’s 280G of data (and getting more every day).</p>
<p><strong>Pruned Mainnet.</strong> This will cut the blockchain you’re
storing down to just the last 550 blocks. If you’re not mining or
running some other Bitcoin service, this should be plenty for
validation.</p>
<p><strong>Testnet.</strong> This gives you access to an alternative
Bitcoin blockchain where the Bitcoins don’t actually have value. It’s
intended for experimentation and testing.</p>
<p><strong>Pruned Testnet.</strong> This is just the last 550 blocks of
Testnet … because the Testnet blockchain is pretty big now too.</p>
<p><strong>Private Regtest.</strong> This is Regression Testing Mode,
which lets you run a totally local Bitcoin server. It allows for even
more in-depth testing. There’s no pruning needed here, because you’ll be
starting from scratch. This is a very different setup, and so is covered
in <a href="A3_0_Using_Bitcoin_Regtest.md">Appendix 3</a>.</p>
