id="chapter-one-introduction-to-learning-bitcoin-core-lightning-from-the-command-line">Chapter
One: Introduction to Learning Bitcoin Core (&amp; Lightning) from the
Command Line</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The ways that we make payments for goods and services has been
changing dramatically over the last several decades. Where once all
transactions were conducted through cash or checks, now various
electronic payment methods are the norm. However, most of these
electronic payments still occur through centralized systems, where
credit card companies, banks, or even internet-based financial
institutions like Paypal keep long, individually correlated lists of
transactions and have the power to censor transactions that they don’t
like.</p>
<p>These centralization risks were some of the prime catalysts behind
the creation of cryptocurrencies, the first and most successful of which
is Bitcoin. Bitcoin offers pseudonymity; it makes it difficult to
correlate transactions; and it makes censorship by individual entities
all but impossible. These advantages have made it one of the quickest
growing currencies in the world. That growth in turn has made Bitcoin
into a going concern among entrepreneurs and developers, eager to create
new services for the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p>If you’re one of those entrepreneurs or developers, then this course
is for you, because it’s all about learning to program Bitcoin. It’s an
introductory course that explains all the nuances and features of
Bitcoin as it goes. It also takes a very specific tack, by offering
lessons in how to work <em>directly</em> with Bitcoin Core and with the
c-lightning server using their RPC interfaces.</p>
<p>Why not use some of the more fully featured libraries found in
various programming languages? Why not create your own from scratch?
It’s because working with cryptocurrency is dangerous. There are no
safety nets. If you accidentally overpay your fees or lose a signing key
or create an invalid transaction or make any number of potential
mistakes, then your cryptocurrency will be gone forever. Much of that
responsibility will, of course, lie with you as a cryptocurrency
programmer, but it can be minimized by working with the most robust,
secure, and safe cryptocurrency interfaces around, the ones created by
the cryptocurrency programming teams themselves: <code>bitcoind</code>
and <code>lightningd</code>.</p>
<p>Much of this book thus discusses how to script Bitcoin (and
Lightning) directly from the command line. Some later chapters deal with
more sophisticated programming languages, but again they continue to
interact directly with the <code>bitcoind</code> and
<code>lightningd</code> daemons by using RPC or by interacting with the
files they create. This allows you to stand on the shoulders of giants
and use their trusted technology to learn how to create your own trusted
systems.</p>
<h2 id="required-skill-level">Required Skill Level</h2>
<p>You do not need to be particularly technical for the majority of this
course. All you need is the confidence to run basic commands on the UNIX
command line. If you’re familiar with things like <code>ssh</code>,
<code>cd</code>, and <code>ls</code>, the course will supply you with
the rest.</p>
<p>A minority of this course requires programming knowledge, and you
should skip over those sections if needed, as discussed in the next
section.</p>

<p>So where do you start? This book is primarily intended to be read
sequentially. Just follow the “What’s Next?” Links at the end of each
section and/or click through the individual section links on each
chapter page. You’ll achieve the best understanding from this course if
you actually build yourself a Bitcoin server (per Chapter 2) and then
run through all the examples over the course of the book: trying out
examples is an excellent learning methodology.</p>
<p>If you have different levels of skill or want to learn different
things, you might skip to different parts of the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve already got a Bitcoin environment ready to be used, jump
to <a href="03_0_Understanding_Your_Bitcoin_Setup.md">Chapter Three:
Understanding Your Bitcoin Setup</a>.</li>
<li>If you only care about Bitcoin scripting, jump to <a
href="09_0_Introducing_Bitcoin_Scripts.md">Chapter Nine: Introducing
Bitcoin Scripts</a>.</li>
<li>If you just want to read about using programming languages, jump to
<a href="16_0_Talking_to_Bitcoind.md">Chapter Sixteen: Talking to
Bitcoin</a>.</li>
<li>If you conversely don’t want to do any programming, definitely skip
chapters 15-17 while you’re reading, and perhaps skip chapters 9-13. The
rest of the course should still make sense without them.</li>
<li>If you are only interested in Lightning, zap over to <a
href="19_0_Understanding_Your_Lightning_Setup.md">Chapter Nineteen:
Understanding Your Lightning Setup</a>.</li>
<li>If you want to read the major new content added for v2 of the course
(2020), following on v1 (2017), read <a

<h2 id="why-to-use-this-course">Why to Use this Course</h2>
<p>Obviously, you’re working through this course because you’re
interested in Bitcoin. Besides imparting basic knowledge, it’s also
helped readers to join (or create) open-source projects and to get
entry-level jobs in Bitcoin programming. A number of Blockchain Commons’
interns learned about Bitcoin from this course, as have some members of
our programming team.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-support-this-course">How to Support this Course</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please use <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/issues">Issues</a>
for any questions. Blockchain Commons does not have an active support
team, and so we can’t address individual problems or queries, but we
will look over them in time, and use them to improve future iterations
of the course.</li>
<li>Please use <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/pulls">PRs</a>
for any fixes of typos or incorrect (or changed) commands. For
command-line or technical changes, it’s very helpful if you also use the
PR comments to explain why you did what you did, so that we don’t have
to research it.</li>
<li>Please Use Our <a
href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions">Community
discussions area</a> for talking about careers and skills. Blockchain
Commons occasionally offers internships, as discussed in our Community
repo.</li>
<li>Please <a
href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a patron</a>
if you find this course helpful or if you want to help educate the next
generation of blockchain programmers.</li>
