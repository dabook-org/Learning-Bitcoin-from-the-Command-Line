<h1 id="sending-a-transaction-with-a-multisig">6.1: Sending a
Transaction with a Multisig</h1>
<p>The first way to vary how you send a basic transaction is to use a
multisig. This gives you the ability to require that multiple people (or
at least multiple private keys) authorize the use of funds.</p>
<h2 id="understand-how-multisigs-work">Understand How Multisigs
Work</h2>
<p>In a typical P2PKH or SegWit transaction, bitcoins are sent to an
address based on your public key, which in turn means that the related
private key is required to unlock the transaction, solving the
cryptographic puzzle and allowing you to reuse the funds. But what if
you could instead lock a transaction with <em>multiple</em> private
keys? This would effectively allow funds to be sent to a group of
people, where those people all have to agree to reuse the funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a multisignature?</em></strong> A
multisignature is a methodology that allows more than one person to
jointly create a digital signature. It’s a general technique for the
cryptographic use of keys that goes far beyond Bitcoin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, a multisignature cryptographic puzzle is created by
Bitcoin using the OP_CHECKMULTISIG command, and typically that’s
encapsulated in a P2SH address. <a
href="10_4_Scripting_a_Multisig.md">§10.4: Scripting a Multisig</a> will
detail how that works more precisely. For now, all you need to know is
that you can use <code>bitcoin-cli</code> command to create
multisignature addresses; funds can be sent to these addresses just like
any normal P2PKH or Segwit address, but multiple private keys will be
required for the redemption of the funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a multisignature
transaction?</em></strong> A multisignature transaction is a Bitcoin
transaction that has been sent to a multisignature address, thus
requiring the signatures of certain people from the multisignature group
to reuse the funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple multisignatures require everyone in the group to sign the UTXO
when it’s spent. However, there’s more complexity possible.
Multisignatures are generally described as being “m of n”. That means
that the transaction is locked with a group of “n” keys, but only “m” of
them are required to unlock the transaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a m-of-n multisignature?</em></strong> In
a multisignature, “m” signatures out of a group of “n” are required to
form the signature, where “m ≤ n”.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="create-a-multisig-address">Create a Multisig Address</h2>
<p>In order to lock a UTXO with multiple private keys, you must first
create a multisignature address. The examples used here show the
creation (and usage) of a 2-of-2 multisignature.</p>
<h3 id="create-the-addresses">Create the Addresses</h3>
<p>To create a multisignature address, you must first ready the
addresses that the multisig will combine. Best practice suggests that
you always create new addresses. This means that the participants will
each run the <code>getnewaddress</code> command on their own
machine:</p>
<pre><code>machine1$ address1=$(bitcoin-cli getnewaddress)</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>machine2$ address2=$(bitcoin-cli getnewaddress)</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, one of the recipients (or perhaps some third party) will
need to combine the addresses.</p>
<h4 id="collect-public-keys">Collect Public Keys</h4>
<p>However, you can’t create a multi-sig with the addresses, as those
are the hashes of public keys: you instead need the public keys
themselves.</p>
<p>This information is readily available with the
<code>getaddressinfo</code> command.</p>
<p>Over on the remote machine, which we assume here is
<code>machine2</code>, you can get the information out of the
listing.</p>
<pre><code>machine2$ bitcoin-cli -named getaddressinfo address=$address2

<p>The <code>pubkey</code> address
(<code>02bfde48be4aa8f4bf76c570e98a8d287f9be5638412ab38dede8e78df82f33fa3</code>)
is what’s required. Copy it over to your local machine by whatever means
you find most efficient and <em>least error prone</em>.</p>
<p>This process needs to be undertaken for <em>every</em> address from a
machine other than the one where the multisig is being built. Obviously,
if some third-party is creating the address, then you’ll need to do this
for every address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> Bitcoin’s use of public-key
hashes as addresses, instead of public keys, actually represents an
additional layer of security. Thus, sending a public key slightly
increases the vulnerability of the associated address, for some
far-future possibility of a compromise of the elliptic curve. You
shouldn’t worry about having to occasionally send out a public key for a
usage such as this, but you should be aware that the public-key hashes
represent security, and so the actual public keys should not be sent
around willy nilly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If one of the addresses was created on your local machine, which we
assume here is <code>machine1</code>, you can just dump the
<code>pubkey</code> address into a new variable.</p>
<pre><code>machine1$ pubkey1=$(bitcoin-cli -named getaddressinfo address=$address1 | jq -r &#39;.pubkey&#39;)</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-the-address">Create the Address</h3>
<p>A multisig can now be created with the <code>createmultisig</code>
command:</p>
<pre><code>machine1$ bitcoin-cli -named createmultisig nrequired=2 keys=&#39;&#39;&#39;[&quot;&#39;$pubkey1&#39;&quot;,&quot;02bfde48be4aa8f4bf76c570e98a8d287f9be5638412ab38dede8e78df82f33fa3&quot;]&#39;&#39;&#39;

}</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>VERSION WARNING:</strong> Some versions of
<code>createmultisig</code> have allowed entry of public keys or
addresses, some have required public keys only. Currently, either one
seems to be allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When creating the multisignature address, you list how many
signatures are required with the <code>nrequired</code> argument (that’s
“m” in a “m-of-n” multisignature), then you list the total set of
possible signatures with the <code>keys</code> argument (that’s “n”).
Note that the the <code>keys</code> entries likely came from different
places. In this case, we included <code>$pubkey1</code> from the local
machine and
<code>02bfde48be4aa8f4bf76c570e98a8d287f9be5638412ab38dede8e78df82f33fa3</code>
from a remote machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:information_source: <strong>NOTE — M-OF-N VS N-OF-N:</strong> This
example shows the creation of a simple 2-of-2 multisig. If you instead
want to create an m-of-n signature where “m &lt; n”, you adjust the
<code>nrequired</code> field and/or the number of signatures in the
<code>keys</code> JSON object. For a 1-of-2 multisig, you’d set
<code>nrequired=1</code> and also list two keys, while for a 2-of-3
multisig, you’d leave <code>nrequired=2</code>, but add one more public
key to the <code>keys</code> listing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used correctly, <code>createmultisig</code> returns three
results, all of which are critically important.</p>
<p>The <em>address</em> is what you’ll give out to people who want to
send funds. You’ll notice that it has a new prefix of <code>2</code>,
exactly like those P2SH-SegWit addresses. That’s because, like them,
<code>createmultisig</code> is actually creating a totally new type of
address called a P2SH address. It works exactly like a standard P2PKH
address for sending funds, but since this one has been built to require
multiple addresses, you’ll need to do a little more work to spend
them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:link: <strong>TESTNET vs MAINNET:</strong> On testnet, the prefix
for P2SH addresses is <code>2</code>, while on mainnet, it’s
<code>3</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>redeemScript</em> is what you need to redeem the funds (along
with the private keys for “m” of the “n” addresses). This script is
another special feature of P2SH addresses and will be fully explained in
<a href="10_3_Running_a_Bitcoin_Script_with_P2SH.md">§10.3: Running a
Bitcoin Script with P2SH</a>. For now, just be aware that it’s a bit of
data that’s required to get your money.</p>
<p>The <em>descriptor</em> is the standardized description for an
address that we met in <a
href="03_5_Understanding_the_Descriptor.md">§3.5: Understanding the
Descriptor</a>. It provides one way that you could import this address
back to the other machine, using the <code>importmulti</code> RPC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a P2SH address?</em></strong> P2SH stands
for Pay-to-script-hash. It’s a different type of recipient than a
standard P2PKH address or even a Bech32, used for funds whose redemption
are based on more complex Bitcoin Scripts. <code>bitcoin-cli</code> uses
P2SH encapsulation to help standardize and simplify its multisigs as
“P2SH multisigs”, just like P2SH-SegWit was using P2SH to standardize
its SegWit addresses and make them fully backward compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>WARNING:</strong> P2SH multisig addresses, like the
ones created by <code>bitcoin-cli</code>, have a limit for “m” and “n”
in multisigs based on the maximum size of the redeem script, which is
currently 520 bytes. Practically, you won’t hit this unless you’re doing
something excessive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="save-your-work">Save Your Work</h3>
<p>Here’s an important caveat: nothing about your multisig is saved into
your wallet using these basic techniques. In order to later redeem money
sent to this multisignature address, you’re going to need to retain two
crucial bits of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of the Bitcoin addresses used in the multisig.</li>
<li>The <code>redeemScript</code> output by
<code>createmultsig</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, the <code>redeemScript</code> can be recreated by
rerunning <code>createmultisig</code> with the complete list of public
keys <em>in the same order</em> and with the right m-of-n count. But,
it’s better to hold onto it and save yourself stress and grief.</p>
<h3 id="watch-the-order">Watch the Order</h3>
<p>Here’s one thing to be very wary of: <em>order matters</em>. The
order of keys used to create a multi-sig creates a unique hash, which is
to say if you put the keys in a different order, they’ll produce a
different address, as shown:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli -named createmultisig nrequired=2 keys=&#39;&#39;&#39;[&quot;&#39;$pubkey1&#39;&quot;,&quot;&#39;$pubkey2&#39;&quot;]&#39;&#39;&#39;

{
  &quot;address&quot;: &quot;2N5bC4Yc5Pqept1y8nPRqvWmFSejkVeRb1k&quot;,

}</code></pre>
<p>More notably, each ordering creates a different
<em>redeemScript</em>. That means that if you used these basic
techniques and failed to save the redeemScript as you were instructed,
you’ll have to walk through an ever-increasing number of variations to
find the right one when you try and spend your funds!</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0067.mediawiki">BIP67</a>
suggests a way to lexicographically order keys, so that they always
generate the same multisignatures. ColdCard and Electrum are among the
wallets that already support this. Of course, this can cause troubles on
its own if you don’t know if a multisig address was created with sorted
or unsorted keys. Once more, <a
href="03_5_Understanding_the_Descriptor.md">descriptors</a> come to the
rescue. If a multisig is unsorted, it’s built with the function
<code>multi</code> and if it’s sorted it’s built with the function
<code>sortedmulti</code>.</p>
<p>If you look at the <code>desc</code>riptor for the multisig that you
created above, you’ll see that Bitcoin Core doesn’t currently sort its
multisigs:</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;descriptor&quot;: &quot;sh(multi(2,02da2f10746e9778dd57bd0276a4f84101c4e0a711f9cfd9f09cde55acbdd2d191,02bfde48be4aa8f4bf76c570e98a8d287f9be5638412ab38dede8e78df82f33fa3))#0pazcr4y&quot;</code></pre>
<p>However, if it imports an address with type <code>sortedmulti</code>,
it’ll do the right thing, which is the whole point of descriptors!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:warning: <strong>VERSION WARNING:</strong> Bitcoin Core only
understands the <code>sortedmulti</code> descriptor function beginning
with v 0.20.0. Try and access the descriptor on an earlier version of
Bitcoin Core and you’ll get an error such as
<code>A function is needed within P2WSH</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="send-to-a-multisig-address">Send to a Multisig Address</h2>

<p>As you can see, there was nothing unusual in the creation of the
transaction, and it looked entirely normal, albeit with an address with
a different prefix than normal
(<code>2N8MytPW2ih27LctLjn6LfLFZZb1PFSsqBr</code>). No surprise, as we
similarly saw no difference when we sent to Bech32 addresses for the
first time in <a
href="04_6_Creating_a_Segwit_Transaction.md">§4.6</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-sending-a-transaction-with-a-multisig">Summary: Sending
a Transaction with a Multisig</h2>
<p>Multisig addresses lock funds to multiple private keys — possibly
requiring all of those private keys for redemption, and possibly
requiring just some from the set. They’re easy enough to create with
<code>bitcoin-cli</code> and they’re entirely normal to send to. This
ease is due in large part to the invisible use of P2SH
(pay-to-script-hash) addresses, a large topic that we’ve touched upon
twice now, with P2SH-SegWit and multisig addresses, and one that will
get more coverage in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:fire: <strong><em>What is the power of
multisignatures?</em></strong> Multisignatures allow the modeling of a
variety of financial arrangements such as corporations, partnerships,
committees, and other groups. A 1-of-2 multisig might be a married
couple’s joint bank account, while a 2-of-2 multisig might be used for
large expenditures by a Limited Liability Partnership. Multisignatures
also form one of the bases of Smart Contracts. For example, a real
estate deal could be closed with a 2-of-3 multisig, where the signatures
are submitted by the buyer, the seller, and an escrow agent. Once the
escrow agent agrees that all of the conditions have been met, he frees
up the funds for the seller; or alternatively, the buyer and seller can
jointly free the funds.</p>
