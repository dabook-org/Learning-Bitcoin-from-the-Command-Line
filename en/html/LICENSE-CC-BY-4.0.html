Public Licenses</h3>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and
certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public
licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public
permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and
certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should
read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose
before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material
as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to
the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used
under an exception or limitation to copyright. <a
href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors">More
considerations for licensors</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of
our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the
licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example,
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that
use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions
under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority
to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other
reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all
changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses,
you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. <a

<p>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and
agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License (“Public License”). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
Material available under these terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Section 1 – Definitions.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Adapted Material</strong> means material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the
Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,
altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted
Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in
timed relation with a moving image.</li>
<li><strong>Adapter’s License</strong> means the license You apply to
Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted
Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public
License.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright and Similar Rights</strong> means copyright and/or
similar rights closely related to copyright including, without
limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis
Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified
in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.</li>
<li><strong>Effective Technological Measures</strong> means those
measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be
circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the
WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar
international agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions and Limitations</strong> means fair use, fair
dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and
Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.</li>
<li><strong>Licensed Material</strong> means the artistic or literary
work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this
Public License.</li>
<li><strong>Licensed Rights</strong> means the rights granted to You
subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are
limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of
the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to
license.</li>
<li><strong>Licensor</strong> means the individual(s) or entity(ies)
granting rights under this Public License.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> means to provide material to the public by
any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights,
such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
available to the public including in ways that members of the public may
access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them.</li>
<li><strong>Sui Generis Database Rights</strong> means rights other than
copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
equivalent rights anywhere in the world.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong> means the individual or entity exercising the
Licensed Rights under this Public License. <strong>Your</strong> has a
corresponding meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 2 – Scope.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>License grant</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in
the Licensed Material to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
and</li>
<li>produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
6(a).</p></li>
<li><p>Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
Material.</p></li>
<li><p>Downstream recipients.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the
Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
Public License.</li>
<li>No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts
exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
Material.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your
use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed,
or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to
receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Other rights</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under
this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
but not otherwise.</li>
<li>Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
License.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the
Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 3 – License Conditions.</strong></p>
<p>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Attribution</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
You must:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
Licensed Material:
<ol type="1">
<li>identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner
requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);</li>
<li>a copyright notice;</li>
<li>a notice that refers to this Public License;</li>
<li>a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;</li>
<li>a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
indication of any previous modifications; and</li>
<li>indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
Public License.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You
Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to
satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
that includes the required information.</p></li>
<li><p>If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
practicable.</p></li>
<li><p>If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter’s License
You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
complying with this Public License.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.</strong></p>
<p>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;</li>
<li>if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material; and</li>
<li>You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include
other Copyright and Similar Rights.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of
Liability.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to
the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
apply to You.</strong></li>
<li><strong>To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be
liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or
damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
apply to You.</strong></li>
<li>The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 6 – Term and Termination.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated
under Section 6(a), it reinstates:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</li>
<li>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have
to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public License.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.</li>
<li>Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of
the terms and conditions of this Public License.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Section 8 – Interpretation.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on
any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting
the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.</li>
<li>No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.</li>
<li>Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
jurisdiction or authority.</li>
