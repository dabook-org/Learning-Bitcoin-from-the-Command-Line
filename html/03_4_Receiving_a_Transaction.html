<h1 id="receiving-a-transaction">3.4: Receiving a Transaction</h1>
<p>You’re now ready to receive some money at the new address you set
up.</p>
<h2 id="get-some-money">Get Some Money</h2>
<p>To do anything more, you need to get some money. On testnet this is
done through faucets. Since the money is all pretend, you just go to a
faucet, request some money, and it will be sent over to you. We suggest
using the faucet at https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/,
https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/, or https://testnet.coinfaucet.eu/en/. If
they’re not available for some reason, search for “bitcoin testnet
faucet”, and you should find others.</p>
<p>To use a faucet, you’ll usually need to go to a URL and copy and
paste in your address. Note that this is one of those cases where you
won’t be able to use command-line variables, alas. Afterward, a
transaction will be created that sends money from the faucet to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a transaction?</em></strong> A transaction
is a bitcoin exchange. The owner of some bitcoins uses his private key
to access those coins, then locks the transaction using the recipient’s
public key.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:link: <strong>TESTNET vs MAINNET:</strong> Sadly, there are no
faucets in real life. If you were playing on the mainnet, you’d need to
go and actually buy bitcoins at a bitcoin exchange or ATM, or you’d need
to get someone to send them to you. Testnet life is much easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="verify-your-money">Verify Your Money</h2>
<p>After you’ve requested your money, you should be able to verify it
with the <code>bitcoin-cli getbalance</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli getbalance
0.00000000</code></pre>
<p>But wait, there’s no balance yet!?</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of Bitcoin latency. The problem is that your
transaction hasn’t yet been recorded in a block!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a block?</em></strong> Transactions are
transmitted across the network and gathered into blocks by miners. These
blocks are secured with a mathematical proof-of-work, which proves that
computing power has been expended as part of the block creation. It’s
that proof-of-work (multiplied over many blocks, each built atop the
last) that ultimately keeps Bitcoin secure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is a miner?</em></strong> A miner is a
participant of the Bitcoin network who works to create blocks. It’s a
paying job: when a miner successfully creates a block, he is paid a
one-time reward plus the fees for the transactions in his block. Mining
is big business. Miners tend to run on special hardware, accelerated in
ways that make it more likely that they’ll be able to create blocks.
They also tend to be part of mining pools, where the miners all agree to
share out the rewards when one of them successfully creates a block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, <code>bitcoin-cli getunconfirmedbalance</code> should
still show your updated balance as long as the initial transaction has
been created:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli getunconfirmedbalance
0.01010000</code></pre>
<p>If that’s still showing a zero too, you’re probably moving through
this tutorial too fast. Wait a second. The coins should show up
unconfirmed, then rapidly move to confirmed. Do note that a coin can
move from unconfirmedbalance to confirmedbalance almost immediately, so
make sure you check both. However, if your <code>getbalance</code> and
your <code>getunconfirmedbalance</code> both still show zero in ten
minutes, then there’s probably something wrong with the faucet, and
you’ll need to pick another.</p>
<h3 id="gain-confidence-in-your-money">Gain Confidence in Your
Money</h3>
<p>You can use <code>bitcoin-cli getbalance "*" [n]</code>, where you
replace <code>[n]</code> with an integer, to see if a confirmed balance
is ‘n’ blocks deep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>What is block depth?</em></strong> After a block
is built and confirmed, another block is built on top of it, and another
… Because this is a stochastic process, there’s some chance for reversal
when a block is still new. Thus, a block has to be buried several blocks
deep in a chain before you can feel totally confident in your funds.
Each of those blocks tends to be built in an average of 10 minutes … so
it usually takes about an hour for a confirmed transaction to receive
six blocks deep, which is the measure for full confidence in
Bitcoin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following shows that our transactions have been confirmed one
time, but not twice:</p>
<pre><code>$  bitcoin-cli getbalance &quot;*&quot; 1
0.01010000
$  bitcoin-cli getbalance &quot;*&quot; 2
0.00000000</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, every ten minutes or so this depth will increase.</p>
<p>Of course, on the testnet, no one is that worried about how reliable
your funds are. You’ll be able to spend your money as soon as it’s
confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="verify-your-wallet">Verify Your Wallet</h2>
<p>The <code>bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo</code> command gives you more
information on the balance of your wallet:</p>
<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
{
  &quot;walletname&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;walletversion&quot;: 169900,

<p>This shows two transactions
(<code>8e2ab10cabe9ec04ed438086a80b1ac72558cc05bb206e48fc9a18b01b9282e9</code>)
and
(<code>ca4898d8f950df03d6bfaa00578bd0305d041d24788b630d0c4a32debcac9f36</code>)
for a specific amount (<code>0.01000000</code> and
<code>0.00010000</code>), which were both received
(<code>receive</code>) by the same address in our wallet
(<code>mi25UrzHnvn3bpEfFCNqJhPWJn5b77a5NE</code>). That’s bad key
hygeine, by the way: you should use a new address for every single
Bitcoin you ever receive. In this case, we got impatient because the
first faucet didn’t seem to be working.</p>
<p>You can access similar information with the
<code>bitcoin-cli listunspent</code> command, but it only shows the
transactions for the money that you haven’t spent. These are called
UTXOs, and will be vitally important when you’re sending money back out
into the Bitcoin world:</p>

<p>Note that bitcoins are not just a homogeneous mess of cash jammed
into your pocket. Each individual transaction that you receive or that
you send is placed into the immutable blockchain ledger, in a block. You
can see these individual transactions when you look at your unspent
money. This means that bitcoin spending isn’t quite as anonymous as
you’d think. Though the addresses are fairly private, transactions can
be examined as they go in and out of addresses. This makes privacy
vulnerable to statistical analysis. It also introduces some potential
non-fungibility to bitcoins, as you can track back through series of
transactions, even if you can’t track a specific “bitcoin”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>:book: <strong><em>Why are all of these bitcoin amounts in
fractions?</em></strong> Bitcoins are produced slowly, and so there are
relatively few in circulation. As a result, each bitcoin over on the
mainnet is worth quite a bit (~ $9,000 at the time of this writing).
This means that people usually work in fractions. In fact, the .0101 in
Testnet coins would be worth about $100 if they were on the mainnet. For
this reason, names have appeared for smaller amounts of bitcoins,
including millibitcoins or mBTCs (one-thousandth of a bitcoin),
microbitcoins or bits or μBTCs (one-millionth of a bitcoin), and
satoshis (one hundred millionth of a bitcoin).</p>

<pre><code>$ bitcoin-cli help gettransaction
gettransaction &quot;txid&quot; ( include_watchonly verbose )

Get detailed information about in-wallet transaction &lt;txid&gt;

Arguments:
1. txid                 (string, required) The transaction id
2. include_watchonly    (boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false) Whether to include watch-only addresses in balance calculation and details[]
3. verbose              (boolean, optional, default=false) Whether to include a `decoded` field containing the decoded transaction (equivalent to RPC decoderawtransaction)</code></pre>

<p>Now you can see the full information on the transaction, including
all of the inputs (“vin”) and all the outputs (“vout). One of the
interesting things to note is that although we received .01 BTC in the
transaction, another .01010143 was sent to another address. That was
probably a change address, a concept that is explored in the next
section. It is quite typical for a transaction to have multiple inputs
and/or multiple outputs.</p>
<p>There is another command, <code>getrawtransaction</code>, which
allows you to look at transactions that are not in your wallet. However,
it requires you to have unpruned node and <code>txindex=1</code> in your
<code>bitcoin.conf</code> file. Unless you have a serious need for
information not in your wallet, it’s probably just better to use a
Bitcoin explorer for this sort of thing …</p>

Explorer</h2>
<p>Even looking at the verbose information for a transaction can be a
little intimidating. The main goal of this tutorial is to teach how to
deal with raw transactions from the command line, but we’re happy to
talk about other tools when they’re applicable. One of those tools is a
block explorer, which you can use to look at transactions from a web
browser in a much friendlier format.</p>
<p>Currently, our preferred block explorer is <a
href="https://live.blockcypher.com/">https://live.blockcypher.com/</a>.</p>
<p>You can use it to look up transactions for an address:</p>

<p>You can also use it to look at individual transactions:</p>

<p>A block explorer doesn’t generally provide any more information than
a command line look at a raw transaction; it just does a good job of
highlighting the important information and putting together the puzzle
pieces, including the transaction fees behind a transaction — another
concept that we’ll be covering in future sections.</p>
<h2 id="summary-receiving-a-transaction">Summary: Receiving a
Transaction</h2>
<p>Faucets will give you money on the testnet. They come in as raw
transactions, which can be examined with <code>gettransaction</code> or
a block explorer. Once you’ve receive a transaction, you can see it in
your balance and your wallet.</p>
