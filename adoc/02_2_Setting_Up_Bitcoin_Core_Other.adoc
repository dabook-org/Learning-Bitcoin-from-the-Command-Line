= 2.2: Setting Up a Bitcoin-Core Machine via Other Means

The previous section, xref:02_1_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.adoc[ยง2.1: Setting Up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with Bitcoin Standup], presumed that you would be creating a full node on a VPS using a Linode Stackscript.
However, you can actually create a Bitcoin-Core instance via any methodology of your choice and still follow along with the later steps of this tutorial.

Following are other setup methodologies that we are aware of:

* _xref:A2_0_Compiling_Bitcoin_from_Source.adoc[Compiling from Source]._ If you prefer to compile Bitcoin Core by hand, that's covered in Appendix 2.
* _https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS[Using GordianServer-macOS]._ If you have a modern Mac, you can use Blockchain Commons' _GordianNode_ app, powered by _BitcoinStandup_, to install a full node on your Mac.
* _https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts[Using Other Bitcoin Standup Scripts]._ Blockchain Commons also offers a version of the Linode script that you used that can be run from the command line on any Debian or Ubuntu machine.
This tends to be the leading-edge script, which means that it's more likely to feature new functions, like Lightning installation.
* _https://wolfmcnally.com/115/developer-notes-setting-up-a-bitcoin-node-on-aws/[Setting Up a Bitcoin Node on AWS]._ @wolfmcnally has written a step-by-step tutorial for setting up Bitcoin-Core with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* _https://medium.com/@meeDamian/bitcoin-full-node-on-rbp3-revised-88bb7c8ef1d1[Setting Up a Bitcoin Node on a Raspberry Pi 3]._ Damian Mee explains how to set up a headless full node on a Raspberry Pi 3.
