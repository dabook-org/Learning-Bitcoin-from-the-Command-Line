= Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.2.0

[discrete]
=== _by Christopher Allen and Shannon Appelcline_

image::https://www.blockchaincommons.com/images/projects/lbtc-screen.png[]

Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line is a tutorial for working with Bitcoin (and Lightning) that teaches direct interaction with the servers themselves, as the most robust and secure way to begin cryptocurrency work.

NOTE: This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers.
It is not yet ready for use.

_This tutorial assumes that you have some minimal background of how to use the command line interface.
If not, there are many tutorials available, and I have one for Mac users at https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line._
